Then in Eclipse, rightclick on the project and choose "Debug as", "Debug Configuration".
Rightclick on "Remote Java Application" and choose 'new'. Choose "Standard (Socket-Attach)", "localhost" and as Port: 9999.
Then Start Debug in Eclipse. 

(Now you can set Breakpoints in Eclipse and klick through the started Webapp. 
If you hit a place where a Breakpoint in Eclipse is set, Eclipse will jump into and you can Debug as Remote from Eclipse)
